# WebNet Builder: No-Code Neural Network Development

Developed by Andreas MÃ¼ller as part of a master thesis, WebNet Builder is an innovative No-Code platform for constructing neural networks directly within a web browser. Leveraging TensorFlow.js, it offers a user-friendly interface for comprehensive neural network development, with key features including:

- **Interactive Neural Network Architecture Design**: Utilize a drag-and-drop interface for building custom neural network models.
- **Flexible Project Management**: Seamlessly manage your projects with features like ZIP file import and export.
- **Data Handling Capabilities**: Import CSV datasets and perform necessary data preprocessing.
- **Browser-Based Training**: Train neural networks in-browser using various computational backends such as CPU, Web Assembly, WebGL and WebGPU.
- **Training Progress Visualization**: Monitor and visualize the training process of neural networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess and compare the performance of different trained neural network models.

WebNet Builder democratizes neural network development, making it accessible and efficient for users without coding expertise.
